Insane, I was watching the 2960 call and it was up 600,000% at one point lol
Wait so where exactly was this tip??
Where was this tip
Why would announcing a stock split make options go up thousands of percentage points?

Also this was announced after hours so how did you know?
Lol just so everyone knows, option contacts get split as well. The strike price is now 3180/50 for 100*50 shares.
Damn Chipotle is expensive af
No tip on WSB.. apart from this🥲

Might move like 0.02 percent if were lucky 
I get the feeling we’ll see future posts about “ why is Intel down after the gov funding?”
Up 2% max ONLY because I have calls.
gets 8.5B , will probably awards 4.5B in bonuses to executives .  you know the drill
Intel awarded $8.5B, loans $11B, amd tax incentives to build chip factories in the USA. Not to mention Intel just acquired the latest UVA chip machine from ASML that can produce 1.8nm chips which Microsoft had parterned with to power their latest AI supercomputers
If revenue were going to skyrocket, Intel would have re-invested domestically ages ago

This is being funded by the government because it's a strategic play, not a profit play
So did nancy buy intel stock any point before this or any of her buddys in congress?

Looks like it was back in june 2023. Wonder how long they were working on this deal then.

Another edit, biden went to look at the fab build up back in September so nancy definitely bought in early with known insider info.
Stocks boomeranged, millions in bonuses, no forward momentum, congress fires another $15 billion towards intel> rinse and repeat.

Congress is great at picking stocks, terrible at picking companies to invest in.
What do you mean revenues will skyrocket? First time here? That money’s going straight to Intel executive wallets, no where else"

Bought at open yesterday after that one dude made a highly regarded post about it. Sold earlier today for a solid 700% gain. I’ll watch from the sidelines now.
Dude... hush. There are some of us here making money off these Tooks.
These are the instances where I wish I could sell naked calls. Probably for the best I can’t tho.
This stock 10x’d in a week back in 2021, I know it’s almost certainly not going to hit 90 by Friday, but damn dude, doesn’t seem worth the risk for a couple hundred dollars

Semiconductors runs in their blood, just like their father, and their father’s father. Some say they are descendants of an AI chip themselves, but that story is for another day.
Imagine being the CEO of AMD and having to hear about your way more successful cousin from your mom
Those family reunions could make or break our future retirement accounts
We merely adopted AI. They were born in it.
Plot twist: they’re not really competitors and monopolize the industry.

Not surprised. It's an election year. Fed will keep the party going no matter how bad inflation gets.

>NVIDIA's CEO is Jensen Huang, appointed in Apr 1993, has a tenure of 30.92 years. total yearly compensation is $21.36M, comprised of 4.7% salary and 95.3% bonuses, including company stock and options. directly owns 3.52% of the company's shares, worth €70.48B.

Ya what could really motivate this guy? We may never know
He owns nearly 10% of shares and you wonder how he stays motivated? What is 10% of 2 trillion? A lot of fucking motivation.
Why is it so hard to understand facts - When they created Musk's pay package, it was based on goals that were nearly impossible, and that's why it was even granted.

It would be the equivalent if tomorrow they tell INTC CEO Pat Gellsinger that he can have a $50 billion pay package, and all he has to do is increase the company's value 10-fold, surpass TSMC, and outsell NVDA in AI chips within 5 years.

I know it's easy to hate musk, but in order to collect that pay package, he had to create 100s of billions of dollars of market value for TSLA shareholders and coincidentally make millionaires out of tons of employees (including factory workers) whose pay was heavily incentivized through stock options.

Other company shareholders should beg for their CEOs to be paid this way. Instead, most CEOs collects 10s of millions of dollars, even if they turn the company into a fucking dumpster fire, or the stock value goes nowhere for years.
Just to show how institutional and individual investors are fucking morons.. most slept on NVIDIA and went all in on Tesla because of the cult of personality that is Elmo.. all the while Jensen is there fucking delivering.. how many idiots were talking about fucking DOJO beating Nvidia because they had a CGI image of it saying it would be the bestest ever.. idiots
No. Just like tesla had a huge leg up in timing and could not stop the waves of competition. Same thing will happen with nvidia down the stretch.
Jensen doesn’t talk crap like Musk, he just delivered returns to shareholders.
Maybe Elon shouldn’t have sold 32,000 BTC a couple years ago.
Was he high when he told this
Maybe he'll pull it off, but I'm highly skeptical of any tech product that tries to dabble in every field. I'd rather invest in a highly specialized company than the jack of all trades company. 

X doing phone calls, video, payments, ai, etc... no thanks. I just wanted Twitter."
Does anyone in here actually believe inflation numbers?,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bjlim1/does_anyone_in_here_actually_believe_inflation/,"

I live in France and oh boy has good gone up. Where I used to see 1's and then the cents is now a bunch of 2-3's. I've also noticed some of the things I like have reduced the size. Ive actually been eating a whole lot healthier because it's cheaper to buy and prepare veggies fresh.
We buy 90% of our groceries at WalMart. We get a few bulk items elsewhere. As such, we easily can track what we spent four years ago to now. 

We easily spend 50% more a week.
My thoughts are buy stonks, all that extra money you paid ends up in the stock market!
State by state is different ,even city by city ,South Florida a lot still at ath
Inflation is much much higher and gl if you don’t own property yet
The inflation numbers are highly manipulated - they use thing like hedonic adjustments, substitution (Ex: If steak gets too expensive, then people will just eat ground beef), etc.

It's never as clear as it looks - and yes, it's total bullshit. Gd 12 pack of diet-dr pepper is up 100%
Every couple months when coupons show up for local fast food chains, their ""deals"" are always up by .50 - 1.00. Its like they DONT want me to eat their shitty food anymore.
Nope, everybody pays way more than those shenanigans numbers
The numbers are made from “the federal reserve’s preferred inflation index” aka we slashed everything that makes sense from the calculations so we can separate ourselves from the blame of doing a fuck awful job. You’re not crazy they are just lying by omission."
